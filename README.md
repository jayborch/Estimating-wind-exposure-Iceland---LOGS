# Estimating-wind-exposure-Iceland---LOGS
This repository contains tools and workflows for modeling wind exposure across Iceland with the aim of supporting tree planting and ecological studies, particularly for birch (Betula spp.). By combining wind observations, terrain data, and physics-informed machine learning, the project generates high-resolution wind exposure maps that capture how complex terrain influences wind patterns. These maps can be integrated into species distribution models (SDMs) or used to assess site suitability for tree growth.

The workflow begins with the extraction of wind data from observational points and wind roses. Terrain features are derived from a 10 m digital elevation model (DEM), including slope, aspect, curvature, and upwind sheltering. Using physics-informed machine learning, the model predicts wind speed and dominant wind direction across the landscape, producing continuous 10 m resolution rasters that reflect both the magnitude and directional influence of wind.

These rasters can then be incorporated into SDMs to evaluate the influence of wind exposure on tree growth, seedling establishment, and long-term forest planning. By integrating terrain-driven wind dynamics, the approach provides a practical and scalable way to account for a critical ecological driver in Iceland’s unique landscapes. The repository includes scripts, example data, and guidance for applying this workflow to other regions or species.
